# Overview

This application starts you off in a text adventure game. The player will have to navigate using keywords about what to do next in the story. This game is designed to be played more than once, having a total of 12 endings. In terms of code, the game is mainly just if else statements and calls for input, alongside slight pauses in the game. Upon getting an ending, the game resets.

I created this application to challenge myself and expand on something I did before and refine it now that I know more about coding.
