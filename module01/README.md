# Overview

In this application, you will play a game of hangman. There's a selection of several words, and you have a select number of attempts to get the right letters. Regardless of whether you win or lose, it will tell you what the selected word was. Upon starting, the game selects a secret word that you must figure out. You have to input a letter, and the game will tell you if you got it right or wrong. If you got it wrong, it will tell you how many tries you have left. If you got it wrong, but it's a letter you already guessed, you will not lose a point. If you get it right, the letter will show up on the word and you will not lose a point. If you win, the game will tell you that you got the word in X amount of tries. If you lose, you get the game over screen and it tells you what the right word was.

I created this application for fun, and for the sake of improving my understanding of the Java coding language.
