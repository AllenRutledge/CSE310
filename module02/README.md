# Overview

This application will play music from a provided list of songs. You can adjust the volume, position of the music, pause, resume, go to the next song, and go to the previous song. If the current song ends, it will automatically transition to the next song. Alongside the buttons and sliders, the player will display the song's name, the song's artist, and which song out the list is playing.

I created this application to challenge myself and expand my knowledge of web programming. Additionally, I wanted to know about web programming to be more helpful with my team activity. I ended up unintentionally making this harder by not realizing I had to do 3 different files for one program with their own unique languages, but I still had a lot of fun with this.
